              "- Acquisitions: Uber acquired Cornershop (grocery delivery), Drizly (alcohol delivery), and Transplace (logistics), and consolidated CS-Mexico.\n",
              "- Divestitures & Equity Investments: Sold its autonomous vehicle unit (ATG) to Aurora Innovation in exchange for equity, and restructured/sold interests in Yandex-related ventures.\n",
              "- Technology & Partnerships: Invested in Moove (vehicle fleet operator in Spain), with a minority equity stake, a $213 million loan, and a commercial partnership. Continued capital expenditures on technology, including assets from Postmates, Transplace, Drizly, and Cornershop.\n",
              "- Capital Expenditures: Issued $1.5 billion in senior notes for additional capital, and entered a reinsurance agreement for legacy auto insurance liabilities, resulting in a $1 billion cash inflow.\n",
              "- Strategy: Focused on expanding core businesses, enhancing technology, and strengthening market position through acquisitions and partnerships.\n",

              "- Acquisitions & Technology: Invested heavily in R&D, completed strategic acquisitions, and expanded its network of shared bikes and scooters. Developed third-party self-driving technology through Lyft Autonomous.\n",
              "- Divestitures: Sold its Level 5 self-driving vehicle division, shifting to licensing and data access agreements with autonomous vehicle companies.\n",
              "- Partnerships & Innovation: Invested in sales/marketing, expanded Lyft Rentals, and supported the Express Drive vehicle leasing program. Received a $64 million non-marketable equity security as part of a licensing agreement.\n",
              "- Capital Expenditures: Included real estate leases (81 locations), finance leases for Flexdrive, and other long-term commitments.\n",
              "- Sustainability: Invested in environmental initiatives, aiming for 100% electric vehicles by 2030 and compliance with California‚Äôs Clean Miles Standard.\n",
              "- Strategy: Focused on technological innovation, multimodal transportation, strategic partnerships, operational infrastructure, and sustainability.\n",

              "- Uber‚Äôs investments were more acquisition-heavy, targeting expansion in delivery, logistics, and international markets, with significant capital raised and deployed for these purposes.\n",
              "- Lyft‚Äôs investments focused on technology, multimodal transportation (bikes, scooters, rentals), partnerships, and sustainability, with fewer large acquisitions but significant R&D and operational investments.\n",
              "\n",
              "Both companies made strategic divestitures in autonomous vehicle technology, but Uber retained equity in Aurora, while Lyft shifted to a partnership/licensing model. Uber‚Äôs investments were broader in scope and scale, while Lyft‚Äôs were more focused on platform innovation and sustainability."
