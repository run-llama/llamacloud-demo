      "Based on the context provided, a few positive factors for Uber's business in 2021 were:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Uber experienced less seasonality in 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of Uber's Delivery business as cities imposed various dining restrictions. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Uber's Delivery offering was attracting new consumers to their platform. Over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers in Q4 2021 were new to Uber's platform overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Consumers who used both Uber's Mobility and Delivery offerings generated significantly more trips per month on average (12.6) compared to consumers who only used a single offering (5.0) in cities where both were available. This cross-platform usage was beneficial for engagement.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Uber launched Uber One in the U.S. in November 2021, a membership program providing benefits across its rides, delivery and grocery offerings, to make using Uber's suite of products a seamless experience for consumers. Uber exited 2021 with over 6 million members across its various membership programs.\n",

      "=== Function Output ===\n",
      "Based on the information provided, a few positive factors for Lyft's business in 2021 were:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Lyft continued to invest in the future through organic growth and acquisitions of complementary businesses, even with the impact of COVID-19. This included expanding their network of light vehicles (bikes and scooters) and investing in Lyft Autonomous to deploy and scale third-party self-driving technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Lyft believes their brand, values and focus on customer experience are key differentiators. As demand recovers from the pandemic, they are confident more people will choose Lyft for the convenience, experience and affordability. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. In the second quarter of 2021, Lyft began generating new revenue streams from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Lyft launched an autonomous rideshare service in Miami in December 2021 with Ford and Argo AI, delivering on their commitment to deploy autonomous vehicles on the Lyft network.\n",
      "\n",
      "So while still impacted by the pandemic in 2021, Lyft saw some positive developments in terms of strategic investments, brand strength, new revenue sources, and progress with autonomous vehicle deployments on their platform.\n",
