    "## Invoice Enrichment with Spend Category and Cost Center Workflow\n",

    "<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/run-llama/llamacloud-demo/blob/main/examples/document_workflows/invoice_sku_product_catalog_matching/invoice_spend_costcentre.ipynb\" target=\"_parent\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an automated workflow for enriching invoice line items with appropriate spend categories and cost centers. The system helps standardize financial reporting and automates cost allocation across departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Challenge: Automating Spend Category and Cost Center Enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations face two key challenges when processing invoices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spend Category Mapping**: Invoice line items come with varying descriptions that need to be mapped to standardized spend categories for consistent financial reporting. For example, \"Dell Precision 5680 Workstation\" and \"HP ProBook Laptop\" should both map to \"IT Hardware\" category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cost Center Attribution**: Each spend category needs to be mapped to appropriate cost centers based on historical patterns and organizational rules. The system uses embedding similarity to compare line items against historical cost center allocations. If the similarity score exceeds 0.85, the historical cost center is used. If the confidence is lower, the item is marked for \"FINANCE\" team review, ensuring manual verification of uncertain cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Documents We Work With\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invoice Data**: (`invoice.pdf`)\n",
    "   * Contains detailed line items for various purchases\n",
    "   * Each line includes:\n",
    "      * Line item ID\n",
    "      * Description\n",
    "      * Quantity\n",
    "      * Unit price\n",
    "      * Total amount\n",
    "   * Contains various types of purchases (hardware, software, services)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spend Categories**: (`spend_categories.json`)\n",
    "   * Contains standardized spend category definitions:\n",
    "      * Category name\n",
    "      * Department\n",
    "      * Description\n",
    "      * Keywords and patterns\n",
    "   * Maps descriptions to standard expense categories\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost Center Historical Data**: (`cost_centre_historical_data.csv`)\n",
    "   * Contains cost center allocation patterns:\n",
    "      * Cost center IDs\n",
    "      * Departments\n",
    "      * Item descriptions\n",
    "      * Historical allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enrichment Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse the invoice using LlamaParse to extract structured data\n",
    "2. For each line item:\n",
    "   * Query the spend category index to determine expense classification\n",
    "   * Query the cost center index to determine appropriate cost allocation\n",
    "3. Generate enriched invoice with categorized line items\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Value Added\n",
    "\n",
    "The automated classification helps standardize financial reporting by:\n",
    "* Consistently categorizing similar expenses across different vendors\n",
    "* Automating cost center allocation based on historical patterns\n",
    "* Reducing manual classification effort and errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Example transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw line item:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Dell Precision 5680 Workstation with 64GB RAM\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Gets enriched with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Spend Category: IT Hardware\n",
    "Cost Center: IT-INFRA-001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow uses:\n",
    "* LlamaParse for PDF invoice parsing.\n",
    "* LLMs for structured data extraction from invoice.\n",
    "* Embedding-based similarity search for spend category matching.\n",
    "* Embedding-based similarity search for cost center attribution using historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input/Output Files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs:**\n",
    "* `invoice.pdf`: Invoice document to process\n",
    "* `spend_categories.json`: Spend category definitions\n",
    "* `cost_centre_historical_data.csv`: Historical cost center allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "* `invoice_enriched.json`: Invoice data enriched with spend categories and cost center allocations"
