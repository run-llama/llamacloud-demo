       "3. Strategic Investments and Innovation: Continued investment in R&D, acquisitions, and expansion of multimodal offerings (bikes, scooters, rentals).\n",
       "4. Brand Strength and Social Responsibility: Focus on values, environmental goals (100% EVs by 2030), and social responsibility fostered loyalty.\n",
